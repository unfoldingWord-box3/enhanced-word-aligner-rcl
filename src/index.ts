// Export components
export { WordAlignerComponent } from './components/WordAlignerComponent';

// If you have types that should be exposed to consumers, export them as well
// For example (you would need to replace these with your actual types):
// export type { HelloCardProps } from './HelloCard';
// export type { WordAlignerComponentProps } from './components/WordAlignerComponent';

// You can also re-export from other index files if you have them
// For example:
// export * from './common';
